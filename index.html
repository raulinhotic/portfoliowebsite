                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p>I'm an aspiring programmer in my 30's from a small village in Germany. I actually studied Business Science but over the years my interests shifted more and more towards everything digital. So I started learning to code on the Codecademy Platform and have enjoyed doing it so far. </p>
                    <p>My biggest challenge is probably that I'm interested in a lot of things and find it hard to really focus on one thing. I also tend to do a lot of things 'by the book' and I have trouble to come up with creative ideas on my own. But confronting myself with coding will hopefully help me to improve in that aspect. </p>

                <article class="textfield objectives">
                    <h3>My Objectives</h3>
                    <p>To be honest I'm not 100% sure about what my objectives actually are. I only know that I'm in for the long run. I'm convinced that you should never stop learning in your life. I'm really interested in Phython and working with Data. So I'll probably end up in Data Science. But before that I want to learn the fundamentals about coding which is why I have started with the Full-Stack Engineering Career Path on Codecademy.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately I'm not the most creative person (which you can clearly see looking at the design of this page) which is why Web Developing (at least the front-end part) doesn't really play into my strengths.</p>
                    <p>I'll hopefully continue to use this page to further document my progress as a programmer and hope to add some Codecademy-independent projects as well. I already have some ideas which I cannot wait to work on.</p>

                <article class="textfield progress">
                    <h3>My Progress</h3>
                    <p>I pretty much followed the Codecademy guide and started my journey into Web Devloping by learning HTML and CSS. After that I wanted to add JavaScript to my repertoire because it is a strong fundament to have to build up your knowledge in other prgramming languages. It took me quite some time to get comfortable with JavaScript but I very much enjoyed the journey.</p>
                    <p>Recently I began learning React which I find very interesting. I'll definitely follow up on that and build some React apps on my own before continuing the journey in Web Developing by occupying myself with some more advanced concepts.</p>
                    <p>After finishing the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path on Codecademy I'm looking forward to dabble into Data Science and learning Python in particular.</p>
